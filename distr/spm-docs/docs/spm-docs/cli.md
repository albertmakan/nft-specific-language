# Using SPM CLI

TODO: explain how to use spm CLI with a few examples - be user friendly, don't try to explain everything in too much details

NOTE: what might help is to have more reusability - you can have sections here that explain how to init, publish, install and version packages, and from other places we can [reference these](./intro.md)
