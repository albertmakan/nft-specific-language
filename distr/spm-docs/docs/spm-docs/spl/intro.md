# Introduction

`SPL` is a _DSL_ (Domain Specific Language) that tries to simplify creation, maintenance and readability of Smart Contracts implemented in `Solidity`.

:::info
`SPL` does not aim to be [turing complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness), like `Solidity`, but to simplify implementing the most common use-cases of Smart Contracts, like contracts for managing `ERC20`, `ERC721`, `ERC1155` tokens for example.
